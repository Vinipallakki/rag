Sure! Here's a **simple README** you can include in your project for your Gemini + LangChain RAG setup:

# Gemini + LangChain RAG Pipeline

This project demonstrates a simple **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** pipeline using **Google Gemini** for embeddings and LLM, integrated with **LangChain** for vector storage and retrieval.

## Features

* Reads text documents and splits them into smaller chunks.
* Generates embeddings using **Gemini**.
* Stores embeddings in **Chroma vector store**.
* Answers questions using a RAG pipeline with Gemini LLM.

## Requirements

* Python 3.12+
* Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install langchain langchain-community google-generativeai chroma
```

* Set your Gemini API key:

```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key"
# For Windows PowerShell:
$env:GEMINI_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key"
```

## Usage

1. Place your text file in the `docs` folder.
   Example: `docs/sample.txt`

2. Run the pipeline:

```bash
python test.py
```

3. The pipeline will:

   * Read the file.
   * Split text into chunks.
   * Generate embeddings and store them in Chroma.
   * Run a query example: "What is AI?"

4. Modify `test.py` to ask your own questions using:

```python
answer = answer_question("Your question here")
print(answer)
```

## Notes

* Reduce `chunk_size` if you encounter `MemoryError`.
* Ensure the Gemini API key has proper permissions for embeddings and LLM.

I can also create a **more beginner-friendly README** with screenshots and example outputs if you want.

Do you want me to do that?
